# Claude Code Software Architecture Principles

## Overview

This document defines software architecture design principles and guidelines for development projects using Claude Code (AI assistant development environment powered by Claude).

## Core Principles

### 1. Reliability-First Design

#### Secure by Coding

Prioritize security at all stages of design and implementation to achieve secure application development:

**Security Integration at Design Stage**

- **Threat Modeling**: Analyze potential attack vectors and incorporate countermeasures into design
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant only minimum necessary permissions
- **Defense in Depth**: Avoid single points of failure with multiple security layers
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Design to fail safely in error conditions

**Security Implementation at Coding Stage**

- **Input Validation**: Strict validation and sanitization of all external inputs
- **Output Escaping**: Proper escaping to prevent XSS attacks
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Consistent use of parameterized queries
- **Authentication & Authorization**: Strong authentication mechanisms and proper authorization controls

**Encryption and Data Protection**

- **Encryption at Rest**: Encrypted storage of sensitive data
- **Encryption in Transit**: Consistent use of HTTPS/TLS communication
- **Key Management**: Secure management and regular rotation of encryption keys
- **Privacy Protection**: Compliance with GDPR, CCPA and other regulations

#### Design Principles for Reliability

- **Redundancy**: Eliminate single points of failure through redundancy
- **Observability**: Mechanisms for anomaly detection and alerting

## Architecture Patterns

### Recommended Patterns

#### 1. Layered Architecture

**Use Case**: Traditional web applications, CRUD-centric systems

#### 2. Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters)

**Use Case**: Complex business logic, systems with extensive external integrations

#### 3. Microservices Architecture

**Use Case**: Large-scale systems, distributed team development, independent deployment requirements

#### 4. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

**Use Case**: Complex business logic, long-term maintenance requirements, collaboration with domain experts

### Cross-Cutting Architecture Principles

#### Domain Object Utilization

Apply these DDD concepts across all architecture patterns:

- **Value Objects**: Use meaningful value objects instead of primitive types
- **Entities**: Business-critical objects with identity
- **Aggregates**: Boundaries of related objects and invariant maintenance

#### Value Object Immutability for Enhanced Safety

**Immutability Principles**

- **No Modification After Creation**: Value objects cannot change internal state after creation
- **New Instance Generation**: Create new instances when value changes are needed
- **Defensive Copying**: Return copies of internal data to prevent external modification

**Safety Enhancement Effects**

- **Prevention of Unintended Side Effects**: Prevent unexpected object state changes
- **Thread Safety**: Safe access from multiple threads
- **Test Stability**: Predictable test results due to unchanging values
- **Easier Debugging**: Limited change points simplify problem identification

**Implementation Considerations**

- **Validation**: Verify value validity at object creation
- **Equality Implementation**: Implement proper value-based equality comparison
- **String Representation**: Provide meaningful string representation for debugging
- **Factory Methods**: Hide complex creation logic

#### Function/Method Design Principles

- Leverage value objects and entities over primitive types
- Use value objects and entities as function parameters whenever possible
- Emphasize type safety and express business concepts through meaningful types

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- **Monolithic Giant Classes**: Designs violating single responsibility principle
- **Deep Inheritance Hierarchies**: Difficult to understand and maintain
- **Excessive Global State Dependency**: Difficult to test and maintain

## Coding Standards

### 1. Naming Conventions

Adopt consistent naming conventions according to project tech stack and maintain same rules during AI collaboration

### 2. Comment Standards

- **Intent Clarification**: Explain "why" rather than "what" in code
- **Business Rules**: Clearly describe domain-specific rules
- **AI Collaboration Hints**: Leave information for AI to understand during future modifications

### 3. Error Handling

- **Explicit Error Handling**: Handle anticipated exceptions explicitly
- **Logging**: Record errors at appropriate log levels
- **Fail-Safe**: Maintain safe state during errors when possible

## Dependency Management

### 1. Dependency Injection

Improve testability and flexibility by injecting external dependencies

### 2. Abstraction Utilization

Use interfaces and abstract classes to hide implementation details

### 3. Configuration Management

- **Environment Variables**: Manage configuration values through environment variables
- **Configuration Files**: Manage complex settings through structured files
- **Default Values**: Set appropriate defaults for non-essential configurations

### 4. Secure Dependency Management

- **Dependency Auditing**: Check vulnerabilities in used libraries
- **Update Policy**: Rapid application of security patches
- **Trusted Sources**: Obtain dependencies from official repositories
- **License Management**: Ensure open source license compliance

## Security Implementation Principles

### 1. Input Validation and Sanitization

- **Validate All Inputs**: Don't trust external inputs; validate strictly
- **Whitelist Approach**: Accept only allowed patterns
- **Data Type Enforcement**: Validate expected data types
- **Length Restrictions**: Implement appropriate character/size limits

### 2. Authentication & Authorization Implementation

- **Multi-Factor Authentication**: Implement MFA for critical systems
- **Session Management**: Secure session management and timeout settings

- **Key Management**: Secure management and regular rotation of encryption keys
- **Data Masking**: Proper handling of sensitive data in non-production environments
- **Data Retention Policy**: Appropriate deletion of unnecessary data

### 4. Error Handling and Logging

- **Information Leakage Prevention**: Don't expose sensitive information in error messages
- **Security Logging**: Record authentication failures, permission errors, etc.
- **Audit Trails**: Traceability of security-related operations
- **Incident Response**: Early detection and response to security events

For web applications, follow [12Factor App](https://12factor.net/) best practices to build cloud-native, maintainable applications:

#### I. Codebase

- **Single Codebase**: One repository per application
- **Multiple Environment Deployment**: Deploy dev/staging/production from same codebase

#### II. Dependencies

- **Explicit Dependency Declaration**: Clear dependencies using package managers
- **Dependency Isolation**: Design independent of system-wide tools

#### III. Config

- **Environment Variable Configuration**: Manage secrets and environment-specific settings via environment variables

#### IV. Backing Services

- **Service Treatment**: Treat databases, queues, external APIs as attachable resources
- **Configuration-Based Switching**: Change service connections based on environment

#### V. Build, Release, Run

- **Clear Stage Separation**: Strictly separate build, release, and run stages
- **Unique Release Identification**: Assign unique IDs to each release for rollback capability

#### VI. Processes

- **Stateless Design**: Application processes don't retain state
- **Share-Nothing Architecture**: Avoid filesystem sharing between processes

#### VII. Port Binding

- **Self-Contained**: Implement web server as application-embedded
- **Service Exposure via Ports**: Expose services through configurable ports

#### VIII. Concurrency
