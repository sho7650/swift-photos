## Legacy Component Deprecation Strategy

### Immediate Deprecation (Phase 4A)

#### High Priority - Remove Immediately
```swift
// DEPRECATED: Legacy ViewModel patterns
class LegacySlideshowViewModel // → UnifiedSlideshowViewModel
class EnhancedModernSlideshowViewModel // → UnifiedSlideshowViewModel

// DEPRECATED: Old Factory patterns  
class ViewModelFactory // → UnifiedComponentFactory
class RepositoryFactory // → UnifiedComponentFactory
class CacheFactory // → UnifiedComponentFactory

// DEPRECATED: Scattered service creation
direct instantiation patterns // → SwiftPhotosServiceFacade

// DEPRECATED: String-based events
NotificationCenter.Name patterns // → UnifiedEventBus typed events
```

#### Implementation:
1. **Add deprecation warnings**: `@available(*, deprecated, message: "Use UnifiedSlideshowViewModel instead")`
2. **Update existing usage**: Replace with unified counterparts
3. **Remove after validation**: Delete deprecated files

### Gradual Migration (Phase 4B)

#### Medium Priority - Migrate Over Time
```swift
// DEPRECATED: Individual settings managers (replace with unified)
class PerformanceSettingsManager // → part of UnifiedSettingsService
class SlideshowSettingsManager // → part of UnifiedSettingsService  
class TransitionSettingsManager // → part of UnifiedSettingsService

// DEPRECATED: Multiple repository interfaces
protocol ImageServiceProtocol // → UnifiedImageService
protocol SettingsServiceProtocol // → UnifiedSettingsService
protocol UIInteractionProtocol // → UnifiedUIService

// DEPRECATED: Direct service dependencies
scattered service instantiation // → ServiceRegistry pattern
```

#### Migration Strategy:
1. **Parallel Systems**: Run old and new systems simultaneously
2. **Feature-by-Feature**: Migrate high-usage components first
3. **Validation Testing**: Ensure functionality parity
4. **Cleanup Phase**: Remove old code after successful migration

### Long-term Sunset (Phase 4C)

#### Low Priority - Clean Up Eventually
```swift
// CONSIDER REMOVAL: Over-engineered abstractions
complex inheritance hierarchies // → composition patterns
redundant protocol layers // → simplified interfaces
unused configuration options // → streamlined settings

// OPTIMIZATION TARGETS: Performance improvements
memory-inefficient patterns // → optimized data structures
synchronous operations // → async/await patterns
```

## File Reduction Strategy

### Current File Count: ~195 files

#### Target Reduction by Category:
- **Services**: 33 files → 8 files (75% reduction)
- **Factories**: 5 files → 1 file (80% reduction)  
- **ViewModels**: 3 files → 1 file (66% reduction)
- **Event Handling**: 15+ files → 2 files (87% reduction)
- **Repository Layer**: 12 files → 6 files (50% reduction)

#### **Target File Count: ~100 files (48% reduction)**

### Consolidation Mapping

```
Legacy Pattern → Unified Pattern
═══════════════════════════════════
Multiple VMs → UnifiedSlideshowViewModel
5+ Factories → UnifiedComponentFactory  
15+ Protocols → 5 Service Interfaces
NotificationCenter → UnifiedEventBus
Direct Services → SwiftPhotosServiceFacade
Scattered Settings → UnifiedSettingsService
```

## Conclusion

This migration strategy provides a systematic approach to transforming Swift Photos from a complex 3-generation architecture to a streamlined, unified system. The phased approach minimizes risk while maximizing benefits, ultimately resulting in a more maintainable, performant, and developer-friendly codebase.

The 50% code reduction target is achievable through systematic consolidation of redundant patterns and implementation of modern architectural principles. The unified architecture will serve as a solid foundation for future development and feature expansion.
