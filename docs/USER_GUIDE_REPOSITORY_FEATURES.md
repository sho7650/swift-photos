## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Questions

#### **"Why is my app using more memory?"**
The Repository pattern uses sophisticated caching to improve performance. While it may use more memory initially, it provides much better performance with large collections and includes automatic memory pressure handling.

#### **"Can I go back to the old way?"**
Yes! You can disable the Repository pattern in Settings > Repository Settings. However, you'll lose the performance benefits and advanced features.

#### **"How do I know which mode I'm using?"**
Look for the indicator in the top-right corner:
- **Green "Repository Mode"**: Using Repository pattern
- **Orange "Legacy Mode"**: Using Legacy pattern

#### **"My slideshow seems slower"**
Try these solutions:
1. Check if memory pressure fallback activated (orange indicator)
2. Reduce virtual loading window size in Advanced Settings
3. Restart the app to clear caches
4. Check Activity Monitor for system memory usage

### Performance Tips

#### **For Optimal Performance**
- Keep your photo collections organized in folders
- Ensure adequate system memory (8GB+ recommended)
- Use SSD storage for best loading speeds
- Close other memory-intensive applications

#### **If Experiencing Issues**
1. **Check Health Status**: Look at Repository Settings > Current Status
2. **Try Legacy Mode**: Temporarily disable Repository pattern
3. **Restart Application**: Clears caches and resets state
4. **Check System Resources**: Ensure adequate memory and disk space

### Getting Help

#### **Diagnostic Information**
1. Go to Settings > Repository Settings > Advanced > Diagnostics
2. Use "Export Debug Log" to save diagnostic information
3. Include this information when reporting issues
