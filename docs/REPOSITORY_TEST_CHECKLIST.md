### ✅ Performance Metrics

Record these metrics for different collection sizes:

| Metric | Small (50) | Medium (500) | Large (5000) | Massive (10000+) |
|--------|------------|--------------|--------------|------------------|
| Load Time | ___s | ___s | ___s | ___s |
| Memory Peak | ___MB | ___MB | ___MB | ___MB |
| Memory Stable | ___MB | ___MB | ___MB | ___MB |
| CPU Peak | ___% | ___% | ___% | ___% |
| Cache Hit Rate | ___% | ___% | ___% | ___% |
| FPS (transitions) | ___ | ___ | ___ | ___ |
